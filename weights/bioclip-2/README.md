# Model Card for BioCLIP 2

BioCLIP 2 is a foundation model for biology organismal images. It is trained on [TreeOfLife-200M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/TreeOfLife-200M) on the basis of a [CLIP](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-L-14-laion2B-s32B-b82K) model (ViT-14/L) pre-trained on LAION-2B.
BioCLIP 2 yields state-of-the-art performance in recognizing various species. More importantly, it demonstrates emergent properties beyond species classification after extensive hierarchical contrastive training.

## Model Details

### Model Description

Foundation models trained at scale exhibit emergent properties beyond their initial training objectives.
BioCLIP 2 demonstrates such emergence beyond species classification by scaling up the hierarchical contrastive training proposed by [BioCLIP](https://imageomics.github.io/bioclip/).
The model is trained on [TreeOfLife-200M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/TreeOfLife-200M) (the largest and most diverse available dataset of biology images).
We evaluate BioCLIP 2 on a diverse set of biological tasks. Through training at scale, BioCLIP 2 improves species classification by 18.1% over BioCLIP. More importantly, we demonstrate that BioCLIP 2 generalizes to diverse biological questions beyond species classification solely through species-level supersvision. Further analysis reveals that BioCLIP 2 acquires two emergent properties through scaling up hierarchical contrastive learning: inter-species ecological alignment and intra-species variation separation.

- **Model type:** The model uses a ViT-L/14 Transformer as an image encoder and uses a masked self-attention Transformer as a text encoder.
- **License:** MIT
- **Fine-tuned from model:** CLIP pre-trained on LAION-2B, ViT-L/14 ([Model weight](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-L-14-laion2B-s32B-b82K))

## Uses

### Direct Use

The model can be used for zero-shot classification provided the species names.
It can also be used for few-shot classification with some images serving as the support set.
Additionally, it is also recommended to use BioCLIP 2 as a visual encoder for other biological visual tasks.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

BioCLIP 2 is trained on an imbalanced dataset. Specifically, the TreeOfLife-200M dataset exhibits a long-tailed distribution across taxa.
Therefore, the predictions of BioCLIP 2 might be biased toward well-represented species. For more details, see the [discussion in the TreeOfLife-200M dataset card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/TreeOfLife-200M#considerations-for-using-the-data).

BioCLIP 2 and TreeOfLife-200M provide great potential to improve and enhance existing conservation efforts, in particular by facilitating recognition of threatened species. 
Unfortunately, as with many open-source efforts to further conservation goals, there is also potential for bad actors to make use of these tools for malicious purposes. Though the improvement on threatened species could make it easier for poachers to identify protected species, these types of tools are a force-multiplier to monitor illicit trade and sales of these same species. The primary risk to endangered species comes from disclosure of precise location information rather than improved classification capability. Our data does not provide geo-tagged information of the organisms included, minimizing the vulnerabilities that could be used in poaching.

<!-- 
### Recommendations

This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. 

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.

## How to Get Started with the Model

You can use the `open_clip` library to load BioCLIP 2.

```
import open_clip
model, preprocess_train, preprocess_val = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms('hf-hub:imageomics/bioclip-2')
tokenizer = open_clip.get_tokenizer('hf-hub:imageomics/bioclip-2')
```

## Training Details

### Training Data

The model was trained with [TreeOfLife-200M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/TreeOfLife-200M) (Revision [a8f38b4](http://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/TreeOfLife-200M/tree/a8f38b4388579862c56ae57d6f094c2ac0e92e12)).
The dataset consists of nearly 214M images covering 952K taxa. 
The scale of TreeOfLife-200M fosters the emergent properties of BioCLIP 2.

In addition, we also used a subset of LAION-2B that consists of 26M samples for experience replay.
This part of data was downloaded from the first three parquet metadata files of LAION-2B, and the first 4,000 tar files were used.

### Training Procedure 

#### Preprocessing

Standard CLIP image preprocessing is adopted in the training.

#### Training Hyperparameters

- **Training regime:** bf16 mixed precision <!--fp32, fp16 mixed precision, bf16 mixed precision, bf16 non-mixed precision, fp16 non-mixed precision, fp8 mixed precision -->

We used an Adam optimizer with a maximum learning rate of 1e-4. 1,875 warming steps were adopted, followed by cosine decay.
The batch size of biological images was 2,816 per GPU, and that of replay data was 320 per GPU.
We trained the model on 32 GPUs for 30 epochs, with a weight decay of 0.2.
Each input image was resized to 224 x 224 resolution.

## Evaluation

We evaluated the model on both species classification and other biological visual tasks.

### Testing Data

For species classification tasks, we tested BioCLIP 2 on the following 10 tasks:
* [NABirds](https://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds): We used 555 visual categories of 48,640 images for test.
* [Meta-Album](https://meta-album.github.io/): We used the Plankton, Insects, Insects2, PlantNet, Fungi, PlantVillage, and Medicinal Leaf datasets from Meta-Album. 
* [IDLE-OO Camera Traps](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/IDLE-OO-Camera-Traps): Species identification in camera trap images is a real-world scenario that BioCLIP 2 can be applied to.
We collected a class-balanced test set from five LILA-BC camera trap datasets. For more information on this test set, please visit the [dataset page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/IDLE-OO-Camera-Traps).
* [Rare Species](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/rare-species): This dataset was introduced in the first BioCLIP paper.
It consists of 400 species labeled Near Threatened through Extinct in the Wild by the [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/), with 30 images per species.
Top-1 accuracy is reported for both zero-shot and few-shot experiments.

For biological visual tasks beyond species classification, we used:
* [FishNet](https://fishnet-2023.github.io/): We used the original training set (75,631) images to train a two-layer linear classifier on top of the extracted features to predict the feeding path and habitat labels.
Then we tested the classifier with 18,901 images from the test set. Accuracy is reported as the metric, where only predicting all the 9 labels correctly counts as success.
* [NeWT](https://github.com/visipedia/newt): We used the 164 binary classification tasks proposed in the dataset. Micro-accuracy is reported across all the samples.
* [AwA2](https://cvml.ista.ac.at/AwA2/): We used the original train-test split for attribute classification. Macro-F1 score is reported across all the attributes.
* [Herbarium19](https://www.kaggle.com/c/herbarium-2019-fgvc6): This is task to discover new species. We implement it as semi-supervised clustering. Clustering accuracy is calculated for the predictions on both seen and unseen classes.
* [PlantDoc](https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Dataset): 2,598 images of 13 plant species and up to 17 classes of diseases are included in this dataset. We conducted the experiment in a multi-fold 1-shot learning fashion. Average accuracy over the test samples is reported.

#### Summary

BioCLIP 2 surpasses BioCLIP by 18.0% on zero-shot species classification benchmarks. 
More importantly, although the model is trained to discriminate different species, it also achieves the best performance on tasks beyond species classification.
Notably, BioCLIP 2 yields a 10.2% performance gap over DINOv2, which is broadly used for diverse visual tasks.
